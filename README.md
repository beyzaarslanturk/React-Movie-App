 # React-Movie-App üéûÔ∏è

 <br>



#### This is a movie application. We see the movies in the project via an API. When a word related to the desired movie is typed in the search section, we can access all the movies in that word. Subjects and scores of movies are also available. This project was completed using CSS, Tailwind, and React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic React.js features. The project was done responsive design.<br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
